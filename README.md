## Overview

Access a collection of free-to-use, standalone components with KokonutUI. Each component is designed with TailwindCSS, ShadCN, and optional animations powered by Framer Motion.

## Getting Started

KokonutUI components are meant to be use with Next.js projects that use TailwindCSS and ShadCN. However they are also compatible with any React Project.

## Browse the components.

Some components require additional libraries, like Framer Motion. If required, these libraries are listed right after the copy-paste button.
