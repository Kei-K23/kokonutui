### 1. Install utilities 

Most of the components use `cn` utility function. Run the following command to install it. As you may notice, this use `Tailwind CSS`, please make sure to install it in your project.

<Tabs items={["bun", "npx", "pnpm"]}>
 
```bash tab="bun"
bunx shadcn@latest add https://kokonutui.com/r/utils.json 
```
 
```bash tab="npx"
npx shadcn@latest add https://kokonutui.com/r/utils.json
```

```bash tab="pnpm"
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add https://kokonutui/r/utils.json
```

</Tabs>


### 2. That's it ðŸŽ‰

We are using [lucide-icons](https://lucide.dev/guide/installation) for most of the components that include icons. As well in some case some [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) components. Those will be automatically installed upon installation of a component.

For exemple to add `alert-02` to your project, it will be easy as:

<Tabs items={["bun", "npx", "pnpm"]}>
 
```bash tab="bun"
bunx shadcn@latest add https://kokonutui.com/r/card-05.json
```
 
```bash tab="npx"
npx shadcn@latest add https://kokonutui.com/r/card-05.json
```

```bash tab="pnpm"
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add https://kokonutui.com/r/card-05.json
```

</Tabs>

*While we provide a convenient 'copy' button for the code, we strongly recommend using the CLI for installing components, as it ensures all necessary files are included.*

Add to your page and it works!
```jsx
import Card05 from "@/components/kokonutui/card-05";

export default function Page() {
    return <Card05 />
}

```

import { Tab, Tabs } from "fumadocs-ui/components/tabs";


### 3. Optionnal dependencies

Some components require [motion](https://motion.dev/docs/react-quick-start) for advanced animation. To work as expected you'll need to install this library.
